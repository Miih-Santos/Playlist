                <p>Keep thinking about his angeleyes</p>
                <p>I keep thinking</p>
                <br>
                <p>Last night I was taking a walk along the river</p>
                <p>And I saw him together with a young girl</p>
                <p>And the look that he gave her made me shiver</p>
                <p>Because he always used to look at me that way</p>
                <p>And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say</p>
                <p>Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play</p>
                <br>
                <p>Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised</p>
                <p>He'll take your heart and you must pay the price</p>
                <p>Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise</p>
                <p>And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise</p>
                <p>Don't look too deep into those angeleyes</p>
                <p>Oh, no, no, no, no</p>
                <br>
                <p>Keep thinking about his angeleyes</p>
                <p>I keep thinking</p>
                <br>
                <p>Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him</p>
                <p>And it hurts to remember all the good times</p>
                <p>When I thought I could never live without him</p>
                <p>And I wonder, does it have to be the same?</p>
                <p>Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?</p>
                <p>Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised</p>
                <p>He'll take your heart and you must pay the price</p>
                <p>Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise</p>
                <p>And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise</p>
                <p>Don't look too deep into those angeleyes</p>
                <br>
                <p>Crazy 'bout his angeleyes, angeleyes</p>
                <p>He took my heart and now I pay the price</p>
                <p>Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise</p>
                <p>And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise</p>
                <p>Don't look too deep into those angeleyes</p>
                <p>Oh, no, no, no, no</p>
                <br>
                <p>Keep thinking</p>
                <p>Keep thinking about his angeleyes</p>
                <p>I keep thinking</p>
                <p>Keep thinking, had to pay the price</p>
                <p>Keep thinking</p>
                <p>Keep thinking about his angeleyes</p>
                <p>I keep thinking</p>
                <p>Keep thinking, had to pay the price</p>
                <p>Keep thinking</p>
